## *Profit-lose management & balance log module of Inventory system*

### Description: 

This module, part of an inventory management system, is dedicated to profit and loss management, featuring a financial transaction log display. The system is divided into two components: a general WordPress website and a software module integrated with it.

I was responsible for developing the software component, utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for data storage. The entire functionality of the software is executed via APIs behind the scenes. For my personal portfolio and visual presentation, I integrated a user interface using Next.js.

The software includes two main modules: user module and transaction module.
